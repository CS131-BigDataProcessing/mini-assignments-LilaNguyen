a) What other types of tasks (provide 2) could benefit from automation using cron or at?
1. Checking for software updates
2. Cleaning up an Eclipse project folder (i.e., removing all non-source code files)

b) What potential risks are there with poorly managed automated tasks, and how can you avoid them (e.g., ensuring backups work correctly)?
1. Data loss; can avoid by testing scripts before automation (can run the script on a tempdir with fake data)
2. Cron jobs that do the same task at the same time can result in conflicts; can avoid by scheduling similar tasks at different times
