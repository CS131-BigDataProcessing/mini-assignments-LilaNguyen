# 1. What are all the airlines? What awk command did you use to get this information?

"airline"
"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

Command used: awk -F, '{ print $4 }' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq


# 2. Which airline has a carrier delay greater than a certain threshold?
## a. Threshold = 10 (sort alphabetically)

"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

Command used: awk -F, '$1 > 10 { print $4 }' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq >> airline_inquiry.txt
 

## b. Threshold = 15 (sort alphabetically)

"Alaska"
"American"
"Delta"
"Jet Blue"
"Southwest"
"United"

Commands used: 
threshold_value=15
awk -v Threshold="$threshold_value" -F, '{ if ($1 > Threshold) print $4 }' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq >> airline_inquiry.txt

I also tried the following and got the same output: awk -v Threshold=15 -F, '{ if ($1 > Threshold) print $4 }' airline_stats.csv | sort | uniq
